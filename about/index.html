                        Over the past few years I've found myself here exploring my unknown potential with scraps of paper and glue.
                        Mine is the story of a life spent masking neuroSpicy-ness and just about hanging on.
                        Im 42, a trans woman, local idiot & full of notions on better ways we could live.
                        We have everything we need to live with nature and without greed' blah blah blah, yeah man..
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        Have been working in the arts more so as a builder most of my life, working rock n'roll gigs to theatre shows from being a stage hand, dresser, lighting technician, all sorts of jobs with the schoolyard builder vibes.
                        I guess it was brave to transition in that environment but little by little I started really living and not just hanging on. 
                        The splash of cold water that was the pandemic brought a natural conclusion to working in a field where you're underpaid, under appreciated and unchallenged.

                    <p>
                        Since then I've been learning more about my MH and challenging myself to grow. 
                        A great friend took me under his wing in the world of film and I excitedly joined in 
                        stretching my creativity finally.

                        This exhibit is brought to you by therapy and prescribed medication and the late bloomer power you can find when you dig deep and challenge yourself.
                        Also please buy something so you can help support my fiancé and our fluffy orange cats whom love & sustain me.

                        Thanks to my Mammy for encouraging me and my dear friends who inspire me.
                        Hold on everybody, it's hard being an earthling but we can at least put on a good show.
